          <p>Every time she blinked, something changed: the bed was gone, her shoes disappeared, her hair grew longer.</p>
          <p>She found a mirror and written in fog: "You have 5 minutes left." But left for what?</p>
          <p>As the final tick echoed, she remembered everything. She had done this before. And failed.</p>

        <h3>üéì Academic Essay: The Influence of Social Media on Study Habits</h3>
        <p>An academic essay exploring how students' use of social media platforms affects their productivity, time management, and focus.</p>

          <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Social media has become a central part of student life. While it offers opportunities for connection and learning, it also presents challenges to concentration and academic success.</p>
          <p><strong>Main Argument:</strong> Studies show that students who frequently check social media while studying tend to have lower academic performance, primarily due to reduced focus and inefficient time use. However, platforms like Reddit and YouTube can also provide educational content if used intentionally.</p>
          <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The key lies in balance and self-awareness. Students must learn to manage their screen time and identify when social media use turns into distraction rather than education.</p>
